# Homework2
This is the second homework given.
Lab 1 : Out parameters

Declare a method which inputs three integers and returns the product ie the value of the three numbers multiplied together. Also return an out parameter which contains the sum of the three integers.

Lab 2 : Passing an object into a method

Create a Cat class which has a name and an age property. Create a constructor method also.

In the Methods class, create a static method called Age() which takes a Cat object as an input parameter. Inside the method, add 5 years to the age of the cat passed in.

Instantiate a Cat instance cat01 in the Main() method. In the constructor pass in the name as 'Tibby' with age 2.

Pass the Cat instance into the Age() method. Repeat this another time so the Age() method is called twice in all.
